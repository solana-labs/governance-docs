# Create a Bespoke DAO

![multisigbespoke](/img/multisig-DAO/multisig-bespoke.png)

:::caution Important note
When you choose to create a bespoke DAO, we assume that you're an advanced user who understands all the governance setup details and we present you a more complex and flexible form than the multisig DAO.
:::

Let's create a Bespoke DAO

---

With your governance setup plan in hand, you should fill the form as follows:

### Step 1: Name, Community and Program

In the first step, you'll need to fill out the basic configuration for your DAO

![multisigbespoke](/img/multisig-DAO/multisig-bespoke-empty.png)

1. **Name your DAO:** Choose the name for your DAO but bear in mind that if you choose a name that already exists, the transaction will fail.

2. **Community Token Mint (optional):** This is where you will enter your community token mint address. When you provide the community token mint, a switch called `Transfer Authority` will show up. If set to active, it will transfer the authority of the community token to the realm.

:::info Community Token Mint - What is it?
The community token mint is the token that will be used by the community to vote on proposals and it is required to create a governance.

:::tip Community Token Mint - Optional
If you don't fill in this field, the community token will be generated by the app

3. **Min community tokens to create governance:** This field represents the minimum community tokens needed to create a governance. There should be at least `N%` of the max supply of the tokens minted, with 1% being the default value for tokens with a supply greater than 0. If the supply is 0, then this value will be set to `1000000` by default.

4. **Community mint supply factor:** The max vote weight of the community token. If it is set to 1 then total supply of the community governance token equals to 100% vote. This value can vary from `0.0000000001` to `1`.

5. **Custom program Id:** This field represents the Governance Program of the organization. If the members of a DAO want full control, they should deploy their own governance program. Solana provides a default Governance program ID `GovER5Lthms3bLBqWub97yVrMmEogzX7xNjdXpPPCVZw` that you can use if you don't want to deploy a governance program initially. You can update your DAO to use your own governance program later on.

:::tip Test Instance
Setting `Use Test Instance` will change the program id to `GTesTBiEWE32WHXXE2S4XbZvA5CrEc4xs6ZgRe895dP` and run a test program instead of the main program. This is recommended if you are deploying a testing DAO.

6. **Governance program version:** This represents the version of the governance program. If you're using the default instance then at the time of writing the version of the deployed program is 1.

7. **Click `Next` to proceed to the [next step](#step-2-the-council)**.

### Step 2: Council Settings

The second step is to setup the council. This step is optional and you can uncheck `Use Council`, which means your DAO will be created without a council.

1. **Council Token Mint:** The council token is a token that will be distributed to the DAO's team. This is usually necessary if your DAO has no community and needs some level of governance.

:::info Council Mint - Optional
You don't need a council mint to create a bespoke DAO. If you want a council, but don't have a token mint id, leave the field empty and we'll generate one for you.

2. **Click `Next` to proceed to the [next step](#step-3-the-summary)**.

---

### Step 3: DAO Summary

The third and final step is to confirm that everything is correct before you create your DAO. If there are any errors, click `Previous` to go back and fix them. Once you have confirmed everything is correct, go aheand and click `Create DAO`.

Once you have signed the transaction, you'll be redirected to your new DAO.
