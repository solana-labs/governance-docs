# DAO Wizard

You'll use a DAO Wizard to get things started. There are two types of DAOs you can create: multisig and bespoke. With a multisig DAO you don't have to worry about governance tokens, governance programs, and other details because the Wizard will provide this information. With a bespoke DAO you have more freedom to customize your DAO, but you will need to provide information to get started.

### Connecting your wallet

The first thing to do is to go to the [Official GUI](https://realms.today) and be sure that you have [Phantom](https://phantom.app/) installed on your browser.
Once you have Phantom Wallet installed, you are ready to connect. You should see a button in the top-right corner to connect your wallet.

:::info Connecting to Devnet
By default, your wallet will connect to `mainnet-beta` but you can switch to `devnet` by clicking the arrow on the button and toggling the `Devnet` button:

Once you have connected your wallet and selected your preferred network, click the `Create DAO` button:

Your wallet will pop up asking to connect to the app:

Go ahead and connect and you'll be redirected to the DAO Wizard page:

The DAO Wizard is a tool designed to help you with the setup of your DAO. It will guide you through the necessary steps to create a new DAO based on the option you choose

_Let's dive into each one of these options._
