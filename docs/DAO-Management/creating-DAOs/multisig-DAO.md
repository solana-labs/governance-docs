# Create a Multisig DAO

![multisigwizard](/img/multisig-DAO/multisig-wizard.png)

The multisig option is the first and easiest way to create a DAO. When you select this option you only need to worry about three things:

1. The name of your DAO
2. The approval quorum (the minimum amount of yes votes to accept a proposal)
3. People who will be part of your team (these will own council tokens)

Let's create a multisig DAO together.

---

1. **Click on `I want to create a multisig DAO` option and the following form will be shown:**

:::tip Test DAO
Toggling `Create a test DAO` will link your DAO to a test Program ID instead of the default Program ID.

2. **Name your DAO**

3. **Select the minimum percentage of `yes votes` to approve a proposal. The default is 60%**

1. **Add team member wallets by clicking on the
   ![teamplusbtn](/img/multisig-DAO/team-plus-btn.png)
   button.**

:::tip Adding team wallets
Note that you can add as many wallets you want, one per line.

:::danger Remember
The current connected wallet is required. If it is not automatically included in the members list, include it or the transaction will result in an error.

**After following these steps, you should have something like the image below:**

**Click `Create` and your wallet will pop up asking for your signature. Approve the transaction to create the tokens and deploy your multisig DAO.**

After the transaction is complete, you'll be redirected to the DAO's page.
