# What is a DAO?

A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is a blockchain-based organization that is often governed by a token. Realms can use SPL (Solana Program Library) tokens or NFTs (Non-fungible tokens) as a form of governance. Anyone who purchases and holds these tokens/NFTs gains the ability to vote on important matters directly related to the DAO. DAOs use smart contracts in place of traditional corporate structures to coordinate efforts.

DAOs control reserve capital in a joint treasury to reach objectives. Users can put up proposals, such as the spending of the treasury or a new business plan. The structure can be set up to incentivize community growth or other success metrics.
