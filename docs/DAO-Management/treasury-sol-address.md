# Treasury domain name
It is possible for a treasury account to have a `.sol` address (eg. `mytreasury.sol`) through [Bonfida](https://naming.bonfida.org/). Anybody can send `.sol` domains to the treasury account. A Bonfida domain points to the current owner of said domain. For more information on solana domains, read [Bonfida's documentation](https://docs.bonfida.org/collection/an-introduction-to-the-solana-name-service).

Note that a domain name must be owned *by the treasury, not the governance itself* to function. Do not transfer ownership of a domain to the governance's pubkey.

## Purchasing a .sol domain name
To purchase a `.sol` domain name, head to [Bondifa's Solana Name Service](https://naming.bonfida.org/) and follow the process.

## Set up treasury address
Make sure your governance (eg. DAO) has a SOL treasury account. See [Treasury Accounts](treasury-account.md) if you haven't set one up yet.

Copy the deposit address of the treasury. This will be the address you'll transfer the `.sol` domain name to.

## Transfer domain to treasury
As mentioned before, your domain must be transferred to the *treasury's address* (the one that you just copied).

Head to [your domains](https://naming.bonfida.org/#/profile?view=domains) on Bonfida, and select the domain you'd like to transfer. Under the "Domain information", "Owner" section, click the "Transfer" button. Paste in your treasury address and hit transfer.

After the transaction is processed, your domain has been transferred to the treasury and is now pointing to your treasury's address. You can send a small amount of SOL to this `.sol` domain name and see that it arrives directly into your treasury.

## Transfer out domain name
It is currently only possible to transfer out a domain name from the treasury to a different address using a proposal with a custom instruction.
