# Get Started

This section is related to building a DAO on the Solana network and covers:

1. What is a DAO?
2. Creating a DAO
3. Adding members to a DAO after the DAO is created
4. Treasury Accounts
5. Treasury Domain Names

:::tip
After this read, you'll be able to create and manage your own DAO.
:::

You'll need to use a Solana wallet (we recommend [Phantom](https://phantom.app/)) and own [SOL](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/). For the convenience, it is possible to use the `devnet` to test if your DAO is performing as it's supposed to.
