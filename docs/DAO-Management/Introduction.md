# Introduction

Realms provides a platform for builders on Solana to create a DAO, manage their members, vote on proposals, and allocate their treasury. Whether you are running a multisig, NFT community DAO, or community token DAO, Realms has the tools and integrations to help your community flourish.

Realms serves as the frontend for [SPL Governance](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/governance), a DAO-type and asset-type agnostic standard for building and maintaining DAOs on Solana.
