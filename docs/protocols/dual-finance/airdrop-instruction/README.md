# ðŸ§¬ Airdrop Instruction

[**Dual Finance**](https://www.dual.finance/) has developed and integrated a plugin that allows any decentralized community on [**Realms**](https://realms.today/) to pass a proposal with instructions to carry out a token airdrop. \
\
Once the proposal is passed & executed, the communityâ€™s Realms treasury is debited by the tokens to be airdropped, and, depending on the route taken, whitelisted wallets either receive tokens or could claim them on the Dual Finance protocol itself.
