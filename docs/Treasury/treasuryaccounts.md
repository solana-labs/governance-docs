# ðŸŸ© Treasury Account

## Treasury Account

A **treasury account** is a shared wallet that holds assets owned by a **DAO**.

Each **DAO** can have any number of treasury accounts holding different assets. Anybody can deposit tokens into treasury accounts but only the **DAO** members can approve withdrawals through treasury transfer proposalsâ€‹.

## Step 2 - Token Treasury

If you want your treasury account to hold tokens (e.g., **USDC**), you have to provide the token address (aka **mint address**) of the token you needâ€‹.

## Settings - Treasury Governance Settings

* **Min community tokens to create a proposal**: The minimal amount of the **DAO** community governance tokens a member of the DAO has to own to be allowed to propose transfers from the treasury.&#x20;

:::info
For Multisig **DAOs** without the community governance token, this value is irrelevant and it's defaulted to an arbitrary number of `1,000,000.`
:::

* **Min instruction hold up time (days)**: The minimal number of days before you can transfer funds from the treasury after a vote on the transfer proposal is approvedâ€‹.

:::info
The delay for treasuries is usually set to `0` to allow transfers of the assets immediately after they are approvedâ€‹.â€‹
:::

* **Max voting time (days)**: The maximum number of days the **DAO** can vote on the treasury proposals. If consensus is not reached by the end of the voting time, the proposal is defeatedâ€‹.
* **Yes vote threshold (%)**: The Yes vote threshold defines the number of Approve votes required to approve a transfer from a treasury account. For example, if there are 10 members in the **DAO** and the Yes threshold is set to **60%**, then at least **6 members** must approve any transfers from the treasuryâ€‹.

After providing all the details, press the `Create` button and the new treasury account will be created and accessible from the main page of your **DAO**â€‹.
