# ðŸŸ¨ Protect a DAO with Civic Pass

## Civic Pass

By default, a **DAO** grants permission to vote through a governance token. In many cases, this is insufficient, and a **DAO** needs to add additional constraints to its membership based on their real-world identity. Example use-cases are:

* Sybil-resistance and one-person-one-vote
* **DAOs** with [**quadratic voting systems**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic\_voting)
* Location-specific **DAOs**
* Bot-resistance
* Age-gated **DAOs**
* **DAOs** that require **KYC**

The [Civic](https://www.civic.com/) Pass plugin allows a **DAO** to connect their DAO to [Civic](https://www.civic.com/) Pass, a platform using the decentralized **Gateway Protocol** to verify and tokenize aspects of their members' real-world identity

Please review the [**Civic Pass Terms of Service**](https://www.civic.com/legal/terms-of-service-civic-pass-v1/) carefully before continuing.

If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with this the **Civic Pass Terms of Service**, you must not continue and may not use the Services.

:::

In order to enable the **Civic Pass** plugin, use the following steps:

### Step 1 (Skip, if already created) - Create a DAO

Create a Community Token DAO in Realms.

![](https://1350030557-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FuD41l732PFwZVguNUpT3%2Fuploads%2FsIDfuueJAmhmLANylC1J%2Fcreate-dao-72b9434779105a40e69ce1363ee9c8e0.png?alt=media&token=5db40827-1cf4-451d-aabf-81f1e494b052)

:::danger
The **spl-governance** program version must be equal or higher than **v2.2.6** for the **Civic Pass** plugin to work correctly.

If the plugin is enabled for **older versions** it can result in **irreversible deadlock** of the **DAO**.
:::

:::info
Set up the **DAO** with a council token.

The **Civic Pass** plugin does not affect the council.

Setting a council allows the configuration of a **DAO** without requiring the council members to first obtain passes.
:::

### Step 2 - Configure Civic Pass Plugin

In order to configure the Civic Pass Plugin, a "**Civic: Create Gateway plugin registrar**" proposal must be created.

![](https://1350030557-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FuD41l732PFwZVguNUpT3%2Fuploads%2FFgAFABpIJxT2VtLz5U6K%2Fcreate-gateway-plugin-registrar-5b6b7821d922e4c2b2cd7ae09bba1b53.png?alt=media&token=ea2d8a7e-2fe5-4809-9748-ce66e1d47056)

Set the community token as the **governance token** and choose a **Civic Pass** typeâ€‹.

:::info
The pass types offered via the UI change as new passes become available. \

Check [**docs.civic.com**](https://docs.civic.com) for more details.

:::info
**Coming soon:** Combining passes.

If you are interested in using more than one **Civic Pass** type at once, contact [**civic.com**](https://www.civic.com/contact-us/) or visit the [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/8H5Kdtr5Wn).
:::

### Step 3 - Enable Civic Pass Plugin

Once the **Civic Pass** plugin configuration proposal is voted on and executed, the **DAO** can enable it through a **`DAO Config Change`** proposal.

From the DAO parameters page, select `Change Config` option

![](https://1350030557-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FuD41l732PFwZVguNUpT3%2Fuploads%2FLZO1ki1M03fM6z1cnX0o%2FDAO-config-change-41d6e74324b45efd549953072ea19823.png?alt=media&token=baf77f9e-d167-41e0-9503-7aa70883c78e)

And set the **`Community voter weight addin`** parameter to the Civic Pass Gateway Program Id `GgathUhdrCWRHowoRKACjgWhYHfxCEdBi5ViqYN6HVxk`

![](https://1350030557-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FuD41l732PFwZVguNUpT3%2Fuploads%2FOz5IdXdHxk0O70HFWN9E%2Fenable-gateway-plugin-0dd7b90e73945298b3fa0cd162621d47.png?alt=media&token=1035ada6-0249-43c7-a86e-60f80ab148f7)

:::info
If you want **DAO** community members to be able to create proposals, as well as vote on them, while still on the **DAO** parameters page, select '**Change Config**' on the _Governances_ section, and check the "Enabled" toggle beneath "**Min community tokens to create proposal**".
:::

### Step 4 - Obtaining a Civic Pass

Once the **Civic Pass** plugin has been added correctly, a button will appear on the **DAO** page.

![](https://1350030557-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FuD41l732PFwZVguNUpT3%2Fuploads%2FufB0xZna5z8Vp3cuRqq3%2Fidentity-button-148fd48a4438b93f9e6b7cc0fbbde879.png?alt=media&token=48392a55-08a1-4361-8796-be641522ed09)

The button shows the status of the current pass. A status of "**Active**" indicates that the member's pass is valid, and they can interact with the **DAO**.

Clicking the button opens an iFrame, which guides the user through the process of obtaining a **Civic Pass**.

:::info
The **Civic Pass** plugin supports composition with other plugins.

However, the Realms UI does not yet expose this feature. If you are interested in using the **Civic Pass** plugin with an NFT Community **DAO**, please [**contact Civic**](https://www.civic.com/contact-us/) or visit the [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/8H5Kdtr5Wn).&#x20;
