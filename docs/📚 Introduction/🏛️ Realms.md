# 🏛️ Realms

[**Realms**](https://app.realms.today/realms) is a platform built on Solana that provides tools for builders to create and manage their own DAO. Using Realms, builders can create their own DAO, which allows them to manage their members, vote on proposals, and allocate their treasury. Realms provides a user-friendly frontend interface that allows DAO members to interact with the smart contracts that govern the DAO.

Realms is built on top of [**SPL Governance**](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/governance), which is a DAO and asset-type agnostic standard for building and maintaining DAOs on Solana. This means that builders can create any type of DAO they want, whether it's a [**multi-sig DAO**](https://paragraph.xyz/@xentoshi/multi-sig-on-solana), an [**NFT Community DAO**](https://paragraph.xyz/@xentoshi/nft-community-dao-on-solana-governance-with-nft-voting), or a [**community token DAO**](https://paragraph.xyz/@legend/create-community-token-dao-on-solana).
