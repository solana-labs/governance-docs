# ü§ù What is a DAO?

At its simplest, a **decentralized autonomous organization** (**DAO**) is a community with a shared bank account. Members of the **DAO** make decisions in a **transparent** and **decentralized** fashion, with smart contracts executing these decisions.

For instance, a member can create a proposal suggesting an investment of the treasury or a program upgrade. The **DAO** members then come together to vote on the proposal. If a predefined quorum votes for the proposal to pass, the proposal is accepted and and executed by a smart contract.

As a result, the **DAO** structure provides a ‚Äúflat‚Äù organizational structure. Each **DAO** member has a voice in the community and the opportunity to drive the direction of the organization.
