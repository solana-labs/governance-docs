# Create a Multisig DAO

The multisig option is the first and easiest way to create a DAO. When you select this option you only need to worry about three things:

1. The name of your DAO;
2. The approval quorum, that is the minimum amount of yes votes to accept a proposal; and
3. People who'll be part of your team, whose will own a council token.

So, let's create a multisig DAO together.

**Click on `Create DAO` on the home page and option and the following wizard will be shown:**

**Then just click `Create wallet`, your wallet will pop up asking for signature. Approve to create the tokens and deploy the DAO.**

After the transaction is complete, you'll be redirected to the DAO's page.
