# ðŸ•¶ Adding Council Members to a DAO

In order to add a member to your **DAO**, follow the steps detailed below:

1. Click on the **\[+]** button in the members panel of your **DAO**.

2. Specify the new member's **wallet address** in the form that appears and press the **\[Propose]** button to create a proposal to add the new member.

{% hint style="success" %}
All the other options of the proposal are **automatically filled out** and you don't have to specify them unless you want to override the default values.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

3. Proposal details:
   * **Proposal Title**: This is the title the other members of your DAO will see when they vote on the proposal.
   * **Proposal Description**: The description of the proposal.
   * **Voter Weight**: If the member is added the voter weight defines how much voting power the member will have. Voter weight of 1 means the new member would have 1 vote in the DAO. The voter weight can be changed in the future by creating additional proposals.

3. After proposing and voting yourself, you have to wait for other members of the **DAO** to vote to add the member. Depending on how the **DAO** is set up a different percentage of members will have to accept the proposal before the new member can be added.

3. When enough members approve the proposal and the **approval quorum** is reached, it is automatically passed without waiting the full voting time (**3 days by default**).
4. Finally, after the proposal is approved by the **DAO** members, in the "**Instructions**" section of the proposal click on the **\[Execute]** button to mint the membership token(s) to the new member.
