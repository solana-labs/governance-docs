# üõ°Ô∏è Protect a DAO with Civic Pass

By default, a **DAO** grants permission to vote through a governance token. In many cases, this is insufficient, and a **DAO** needs to add additional constraints to its membership based on their real-world identity. Example use-cases are:

* Sybil-resistance and one-person-one-vote
* **DAOs** with [**quadratic voting systems**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic\_voting)
* Location-specific **DAOs**
* Bot-resistance
* Age-gated **DAOs**
* **DAOs** that require **KYC**

The [Civic](https://www.civic.com/) Pass plugin allows a **DAO** to connect their DAO to [Civic](https://www.civic.com/) Pass, a platform using the decentralized **Gateway Protocol** to verify and tokenize aspects of their members' real-world identity

{% hint style="info" %}
Please review the [**Civic Pass Terms of Service**](https://www.civic.com/legal/terms-of-service-civic-pass-v1/) carefully before continuing. \
\
By installing or integrating the **Civic Pass** (or Captcha) plugin, you **agree** to **Civic Pass Terms of Service** on behalf of the organization, company or other legal entity for which you act, and represent that you have the authority to bind the same.

If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with this the **Civic Pass Terms of Service**, you must not continue and may not use the Services.
{% endhint %}

In order to enable the **Civic Pass** plugin, use the following steps:

1. **Create a DAO:**

Create a Community Token DAO in Realms.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/create-dao-72b9434779105a40e69ce1363ee9c8e0.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="danger" %}
The **spl-governance** program version must be equal or higher than **v2.2.6** for the **Civic Pass** plugin to work correctly. \
\
If the plugin is enabled for **older versions** it can result in **irreversible deadlock** of the **DAO**.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Set up the **DAO** with a council token.

The **Civic Pass** plugin does not affect the council. \
\
Setting a council allows the configuration of a **DAO** without requiring the council members to first obtain passes.
{% endhint %}

2. **Configure Civic Pass Plugin:**

In order to configure the Civic Pass Plugin, a "**Civic: Create Gateway plugin registrar**" proposal must be created.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/create-gateway-plugin-registrar-5b6b7821d922e4c2b2cd7ae09bba1b53.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Set the community token as the **governance token** and choose a **Civic Pass** type‚Äã.

{% hint style="success" %}
The pass types offered via the UI change as new passes become available. \
\
Check [**docs.civic.com**](https://docs.civic.com) for more details.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**Coming soon:** Combining passes. \
\
If you are interested in using more than one **Civic Pass** type at once, contact [**civic.com**](https://www.civic.com/contact-us/) or visit the [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/8H5Kdtr5Wn).
{% endhint %}

3. **Enable Civic Pass Plugin:**

Once the **Civic Pass** plugin configuration proposal is voted on and executed, the **DAO** can enable it through a **`DAO Config Change`** proposal.

From the DAO parameters page, select `Change Config` option

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/DAO-config-change-41d6e74324b45efd549953072ea19823.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

And set the **`Community voter weight addin`** parameter to the Civic Pass Gateway Program Id `GgathUhdrCWRHowoRKACjgWhYHfxCEdBi5ViqYN6HVxk`

{% hint style="success" %}
If you want **DAO** community members to be able to create proposals, as well as vote on them, while still on the **DAO** parameters page, select '**Change Config**' on the _Governances_ section, and check the "Enabled" toggle beneath "**Min community tokens to create proposal**".
{% endhint %}

4. **Obtaining a Civic Pass:**

Once the **Civic Pass** plugin has been added correctly, a button will appear on the **DAO** page.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/identity-button-148fd48a4438b93f9e6b7cc0fbbde879.png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The button shows the status of the current pass. A status of "**Active**" indicates that the member's pass is valid, and they can interact with the **DAO**.

Clicking the button opens an iFrame, which guides the user through the process of obtaining a **Civic Pass**.

{% hint style="success" %}
The **Civic Pass** plugin supports composition with other plugins. \
\
However, the Realms UI does not yet expose this feature. If you are interested in using the **Civic Pass** plugin with an NFT Community **DAO**, please [**contact Civic**](https://www.civic.com/contact-us/) or visit the [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/8H5Kdtr5Wn).&#x20;
