# Get Started

This section is related to the Multisig DAO on Solana network, and it'll cover:

1. What a Multisig DAO is
2. Creating a DAO
3. Adding members to a DAO after the DAO is created
4. Managing programs using Multisig upgrade authority
5. Adding treasury account (Multisig wallet), deposit and send tokens

:::tip
After this read, you'll be able to create and manage your own DAO.
:::

Before continuing, bear in mind that you'll need to use a Solana wallet (we recommend [Phantom](https://phantom.app/)) and that you own [SOL](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/). For your convenience, it is possible to use the `devnet` to test if your DAO is performing as it's supposed to.
