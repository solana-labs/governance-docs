# Create a Multisig DAO

![multisigwizard](/img/multisig-DAO/multisig-wizard.png)

The multisig option is the first and easiest way to create a DAO. When you select this option you only need to worry about three things:

1. The name of your DAO;
2. The approval quorum, that is the minimum amount of yes votes to accept a proposal; and
3. People who'll be part of your team, whose will own a council token.

So, let's create a multisig DAO together.

1. **Click on `I want to create a multisig DAO` option and the following form will be shown:**

3. **Select the minimum percentage of `yes votes` to approve a proposal. The default is 60%**

4. **And click on the

   button to add wallets to your team.**

Note that you can place as many wallets you want, one per line.

:::danger Remember
The current connected wallet is required. If it is not automatically included in the members list, include it or the transaction will result in an error.

**After following this steps, you should have something like the image below:**

**Then just click create, your wallet will pop up asking for signature. Approve to create the tokens and deploy the DAO.**

After the transaction is complete, you'll be redirected to the DAO's page.
