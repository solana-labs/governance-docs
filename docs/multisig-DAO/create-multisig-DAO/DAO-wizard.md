# DAO Wizard

You have two ways to create a multisig DAO, the simple and the advanced. The simple way, you don't need to worry about governance tokens, governance programs and other details, because the platform will generate everything for you. The advanced way, you'll need to provide all the necessary information that is abstracted in the simple form. To perform this operation, we'll use a DAO Wizard that guides you to the necessary steps depending on the options you choose. So, let's take a look in both cases.

### Before starting

The first thing to do is to go to the [Official GUI](https://DAOs.today) and be sure that you have [Phantom](https://phantom.app/) installed on your browser.
After this step, you need to choose if you want to use the `devnet` or the `mainnet`. Unfortunately, the Phantom wallet doesn't allow us to sync the networks yet, so you'll need to do it manually. If you want to use the `devnet`, add `?cluster=devnet` to the url.

> So the url becomes: `https://DAOs.today?cluster=devnet`.

For `mainnet`, you don't need to do any change the url.

From the main screen, click `Create DAO` button

Then, your wallet will pop up asking to connect to the app. Click connect and you'll be redirected to the DAO Wizard page.

The DAO Wizard is a feature to help you with the setup of your DAO. It will guide you through the necessary steps to create a new DAO. 
In the wizard page, it's possible to choose between two options:

1. Create a Multisig DAO and
2. Create a Bespoke DAO

_Let's dive into each one of these options._
