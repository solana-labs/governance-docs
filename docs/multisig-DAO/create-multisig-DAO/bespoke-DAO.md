# Create a Bespoke DAO

![multisigbespoke](/img/multisig-DAO/multisig-bespoke.png)

When you choose to create a bespoke DAO, we assume that you're an advanced user who understands all the governance setup details and we present you a more complex and flexible form than the multisig DAO.

So let's create a Bespoke DAO:

---

## Creating the DAO

With your governance setup plan in hand, you should fill the form as follows. The bespoke mode is split in 3 steps, let's do one by one:

### Step 1: Name, Community and Program

In the first step, you'll need to fill the basic configuration for your DAO

![multisigbespoke](/img/multisig-DAO/multisig-bespoke-empty.png)

1. **Name your DAO:** Choose the name for your DAO but bear in mind that if you choose a name that already exists, the transaction will fail.
2. **Place the `Community Token Mint`** and note that some more fields will appear in the screen.

   1. **Min community tokens to create governance:** this field represents that to create a governance, there should be at least `N%` of the max supply of the tokens minted, being 1% the default value.
   2. **Community mint supply factor:** the max vote weight of the community token. If it is set to 1 then total supply of the community governance token equals to 100% vote.

:::tip
If you don't fill this field, the community token will be generated by the app

4.**The `Governance Program Id`** field represents the Governance Program of the organization. If a DAO wants full control of their DAOs, they should deploy their own governance program. But to facilitate, Solana provides a default Governance program ID `GovER5Lthms3bLBqWub97yVrMmEogzX7xNjdXpPPCVZw` so, if you don't want to deploy a governance program now, it is possible to use this instance.

:::tip
Checking `Use Test Instance` will change the program id to `GTesTBiEWE32WHXXE2S4XbZvA5CrEc4xs6ZgRe895dP` and run in a test program instead of the main program id. This is recommended if you are deploying a testing DAO.

5. **Lastly, the `Governance program version`** that represents the version of the governance program. If you're using the default instance then at the time of writing the version of the deployed program is 1.

6. **Click next to proceed to the [next step](#step-2)**.

### Step 2: The Council

The second step will guide you to setup the council settings. This step is optional and you can uncheck `Use Council` so you won't have a council for your DAO.

1. **Place the `Council Token Mint`** The council token is a token that will be distributed to the DAO's team. It's usually necessary if your DAO has no community and needs some level of governance.

:::tip
This step is optional, you don't need council mint to create a bespoke DAO but if you want a council, but doesn't have a token mint id, let the field empty and we'll generate for you.

2. **Click next to proceed to the [next step](#step-3)**.

### Step 3: The Summary

The third step will show a summary of all the data you have put in the form. Check to see if everything is alright

**Click create, sign the transactions** and then you'll be redirected to the DAO's page.
